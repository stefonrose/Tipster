## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [X] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [x] Select one of the default tips or enter a custom value.
- [x] Have the calculations updated each time a change is detected, instead of having to press a button.
- [x] Split the bill based on the number of people in a party.
- [ ] Implement a settings screen that can allow for the following:
    - [ ] Set their own defaults amounts.
